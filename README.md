# Tree-Based Optimization
Create decision tree algorithm, random forest algorithm, adaptive boosting algorithm from scratch.    
  
Titanic Dataset and sklearn biuilt-in datsets are used to test the algorithms' performances.  

Code has not been optimized to solve large-dimension datasets due to the long run time.     
  
Potential improvements include using Cython, Joblib, Numpy, Scipy to speed up the code.
