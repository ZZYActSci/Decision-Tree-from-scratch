# Tree-Based Optimization (DT and RF)
Create decision tree algorithm and random forest algorithm from scratch.  
Titanic Dataset and sklearn biuilt-in datsets are used to test the algorithms' performances.  

Code has not been optimized to solve large-dimension datasets due to the long run time.    
Potential improvements include using Cython, Joblib, Numpy, Scipy to speed up the code.
